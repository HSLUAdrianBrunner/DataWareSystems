# DataWareSystems

This repository documents the AWS lambda codes and sql queries for the course **W.DWL03_Data Warehouse and Data Lake Systems** of the group **DataWareSystems**, conducted during the Summer Semester 2025 as part of the Master's program in Information and Data Science of the HSLU.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files:
  - .gitignore
  - README.md
  - Code_Documentation.ipynb
    
To improve clarity and maintainability, all code elements—such as AWS Lambda function scripts and SQL queries—are compiled in the Jupyter Notebook **Code_Documentation**. It serves as a reference for all code-related components mentioned in the uploaded report on ILIAS.

The respository contains the following folder:
  - Old

The folder contains files that are no longer relevant but have been retained as part of a backup.


## Important Note
The notebook is intended for documentation purposes only and is not designed to be executed directly. Code snippets were inserted to provide an overview of the implementation and are not guaranteed to be executable in their current form. The Codes are implemented in AWS, as descriped in the report.
